  include CarrierWave::RMagick

  # include CarrierWave::MiniMagick

  # Include the Sprockets helpers for Rails 3.1+ asset pipeline compatibility:
  # include Sprockets::Helpers::RailsHelper
  # include Sprockets::Helpers::IsolatedHelper

  # Choose what kind of storage to use for this uploader:
  storage :file
  # storage :fog

  # Override the directory where uploaded files will be stored.
  # This is a sensible default for uploaders that are meant to be mounted:
  def store_dir
    sub_dir = model.id % 100 # 100 dirs for all images
    "uploads/#{model.class.to_s.underscore}/#{mounted_as}/#{sub_dir}"
  end

  # Provide a default URL as a default if there hasn't been a file uploaded:
  # def default_url
  #   # For Rails 3.1+ asset pipeline compatibility:
  #   # asset_path("fallback/" + [version_name, "default.png"].compact.join('_'))
  #
  #   "/images/fallback/" + [version_name, "default.png"].compact.join('_')
  # end

  # Process files as they are uploaded:
  # process :scale => [200, 300]
  #
  # def scale(width, height)
  #   # do something
  # end

  #def pre_limit file
  #  if file && file.size > 0.1.megabytes
  #    raise Exception.new("too large")
  #  end
  #  true
  #end

  # Create different versions of your uploaded files:
  # version :thumb, if: :pre_limit do
  version :thumb do
    process :only_first_frame
    process :resize_to_fill => [150, 150]
    process :convert => 'jpg'
  end

  # Add a white list of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
  # For images you might use something like this:
  def extension_white_list
    %w(jpg jpeg gif png)
  end

  # Override the filename of the uploaded files:
  # Avoid using model.id or version_name here, see uploader/store.rb for details.
